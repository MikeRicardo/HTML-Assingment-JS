<h1> Managing your users attention and expectations</h1>
<p>

When designing a Learning System with intellectual challenges central to your theme, it is often tempting to present a lot of information at once. However, as explained below, this is often not the best approach. According to Broadbent’s theory, when faced with processing multiple inputs, humans only have a single analyzer to process all of the information. As a result, multiple stimuli appear in consecutive order, even if they are not related. Thus, the sequence of the user’s attention must be managed according to Broadbent’s theory. This is a key concept to keep in mind when designing your Learning System. If you over-stimulate your user with multiple stimuli this will likely slow down cognitive processing and frustrate your users in their quest to achieve their individualized learning goals.

In addition to managing attention, it is also a good idea to manage your user’s expectations. Past experiences will surely influence the way a user perceives your site and that is why it’s important to keep the psychological concept of “priming” in mind. “Priming” a user is a process in which the users implicit memory is effected by exposing them to stimulus which then influences their response to another stimulus later on. So, although it is a good idea to base your site on a conceptually innovative idea to engage user interest, it is probably not a good idea to use a concept or content that no user has ever encountered before in their lives. This is because users have likely built previous mental models regarding the concepts or content you are presenting them with, prior to visiting your site.  Thus, this prior knowledge is essential in helping to guide their fixations from one area of the site to another.
