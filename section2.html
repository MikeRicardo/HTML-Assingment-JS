<h1> Emotional memory </h1>
<p>

When designing your Learning System, the goal should be to create an emotional environment that is conducive to the learning process. Thus, understanding the concept of emotional memory is essential to designing an effective Learning System due to our emotion’s incredible ability to activate hormonal changes in the body. Emotional systems in the brain have been developed to remember situations that evoked emotional responses and then represent those responses as active states in the body. When designed effectively, Learning Systems can emotionally motivate students to be a proactive part of their own learning experience. Learning Systems designers can establish a positive emotional tone based on past emotional associations with images, sounds, colors, textures, or touch responses.  
Examples are NickJr, and Nick, the design is colorful and vibrant and the games have a light atmosphere while the child is learning how to use the keyboard, mouse, and overall motor skills.
