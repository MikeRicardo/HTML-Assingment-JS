<h1> Sounds conducive to learning</h1>
<p>

Sound is also a powerful tool in establishing the emotional tone of your Learning System. It is important to note that low pitch sounds are associated with men and perceived to be either more threatening or reassuring while higher pitched voices are associated with women and perceived to be less threatening but have a tendency to be taken less seriously. Dennis Haysbert, the All State insurance company’s spokesperson, demonstrates a great example of this. Does the following sound clip evoke emotions of reassurance for you?

Sound is also a cheap trick to catch users attention easily as the neural channel for sound is usually free. However, even if all your users are of the same nationality, a woman may perceive a given signal in a very different way than a man would. That is why music is a cheap design trick that can have a great effect across the board without having to take so many cultural and gender factors into account. Music/sound has a great effect on the “mood” a site evokes from its users. Here is an example of a site that uses music to effectively grasp their users attention. Free rice is a good example for an innovative reward/punishment design. By successfully answering the questions rewards you with 10 grains of rice and progressively, extra title showing how many consecutive answers the consumer has gotten right. The punishment of answering wrong is to lose your consecutive streak. This was really one of the few things freerice was doing well with. As this site was our last project, there is confirmation that this part of the design was designed well for the users.
