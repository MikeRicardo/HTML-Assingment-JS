<h1>Achieving Automatism</h1>
<p>

There are three stages of psychomotor skills. The cognitive, the associative and the autonomic stages. The cognitive stage is when the user is new, the users has to fully concentrate on the task to finish, if they even finish. The associative is a step up, the user has a feel for the layout, but still has to think of how to do something at times. The autonomic is the stage that all web designers want to reach, where most functions need very little brain processing. This is important because it severely reduces the chance of information overload. Because of this, web designers should have many generic elements, such as a visible on focus search bar and tabs somewhere in the top of the page. An about and a login on the upper right, etc.</p>
