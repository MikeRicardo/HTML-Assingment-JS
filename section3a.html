<h1>The challenges of the stimulus response theory: Prepare your users</h1>
<p>

When faced with complex situations humans tend to rely on their basic instincts, which poses a problem for the basic stimulus response theory. The problem is that these “basic instincts” often yield human and animal reaction times that are too fast to be considered responses to stimuli. Thus, when you are designing your 3D Learning System you must find ways to prime users to perform the motor skill your simulation is prompting them to perform before the actual prompt takes place. By helping people to anticipate your system’s next prompt you are essentially helping to “re-train” their basic instincts. For humans, this process is critical in learning new motor skills and eventually achieving automatism.

<h1>Feedback Rate</h1>
<p>
When all else fails, read the manual
Another design concept is design rate, as the generic human being is rather lazy, we will usually skip any instructions given to us. Because of this, people will run to errors, and once that happens, we will finally consult the manual. The brilliance of the mind is of its way of handling priority. As reading the instructions is rather low, we skip it. However, once we can no longer proceed, the priority of said instructions will be raised exponentially. This is important for the designer because the users will learn after they hit an error or received undesired results. During the error phase is when the user will be most open to new knowledge. Just as there is a help button in the beginning, there must be alerts on the specific problems the user is currently facing to resolve his/her problem and remember for the next time.
