<h1> Color schemes conducive to learning</h1>
<p>

As we discussed earlier in the emotional memory lesson, color is a very powerful factor in establishing the emotional tone for your Learning System. In deciding what color scheme to use, it is again important to consider your target audience. While children usually find bright colors intriguing and important in their learning experience, adults tend to cringe at the use of loud or bright colors in multimedia systems. In fact, the majority of adults report a preference for subtle pastel colors. </p>

<p>
It is also important to note that humans perceive objects to be brighter when they recognize the correlation between the object and the color (i.e. a stop sign). Thus, it is important that the objects and graphics used in your Learning System are their rightful colors. If you were designing a Learning System for children that included graphics of blue bananas and orange apples, the cognition of users would certainly be slowed down. You would then run the risk of frustrating your child users or distracting them from the site’s main content. </p>
